# This file runs a serious of lints against the code base, each of which

# of a continuous integration suite, and all new code should pass these
# tests. The currently run lint programs are:
#
# - pep8
# - pyflakes
#
# Generated code such as migrations are ignored, as are any other files
# that would be unreasonable to lint. Think carefully before adding a
# new file to the list of ignores.
