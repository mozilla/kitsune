Different parts of the sites need different sets of jQuery UI. I also didn't
know what parts of jQuery UI we already had selected, so now we have
multiple bundles. Here is what is in each bundle:

* Unnamed bundles: ???
* Rickshaw
    - Sortable
    - Datepicker

The bundles include more, but these are things that shuld be checked on the
jQuery UI custom builder. They pull in dependencies like 'Core' or 'Mouse'.
Images should be shared between bundles, but CSS and JS should not be. We use
the UI Lightness theme.
