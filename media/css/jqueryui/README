This is the contents of the custom jQueryUI bundle here.

- Accordion
- Autocomplete
- Datepicker
- Slider
- Sortable

The bundle include more, but these are things that shuld be checked on the
jQuery UI custom builder. They pull in dependencies like 'Core' or 'Mouse'.
Images should be shared between bundles, but CSS and JS should not be. We use
the UI Lightness theme.
