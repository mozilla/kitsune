        clients and server. Each message is a JSON dict having the keys listed
        below:

        Join. Sent in both directions.
            kind: join
            room: ID of the room to join
            user: Username of user joining (sent toward client only)

        Leave. Sent in both directions.
            kind: leave
            room: ID of the room
            user: Username of user leaving (sent toward client only)

        Say. Sent in both directions.
            kind: say
            room: ID of the room
            message: What was said. Serverward is text; clientward is HTML.
            user: Username of user speaking (sent toward client only)

        Nonce. Identify the user to the server by sending a nonce value.
            kind: nonce
            nonce: the nonce

    There's no facility for private messages yet, but it can be added if
    needed. At the moment, the plan is to implement private help sessions by
    first creating a public room behind the scenes. That will allow additional
    moderators to steal into the room undetected.

        the user ID in redis for a short time. The JS yanks the nonce out of
        the page and sends it back to the server on join, along with the
        socketio SID (implicitly), thus completing the SID-to-user mapping.
        And, because we avoid sticking the session ID in the page, we avoid the
        possibility of session hijacking by any JS that gets injected by an XSS
        attack; cookies are protected from evil JS better (through HttpOnly,
