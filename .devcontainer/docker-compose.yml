    # to cause all processes to run as this user. Once present, you can also simply
    # use the "remoteUser" property in devcontainer.json if you just want VS Code and
    # its sub-processes (terminals, tasks, debugging) to execute as the user. On Linux,
    # you may need to ensure the UID and GID of the container user you create matches your
    # local user. See https://aka.ms/vscode-remote/containers/non-root for details.
