# Mozilla SUMO styleguide

This styleguide documents the customized CSS and HTML for SUMO. [Mozilla Protocol](https://protocol.mozilla.org/) is included as an pinned NPM dependency, so that is used whenever possible. Documentation for components that use Protocol should point to the corresponding links in the Protocol docs.
