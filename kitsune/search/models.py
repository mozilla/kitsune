    As data changes in the database, we need to update the relevant

    such that our index stays up-to-date.

    :arg app: A bit of UID we use to build the signal handlers'
        dispatch_uids.  This is prepended to the ``sender_class``
        model name, "elastic", and the signal name, so it should
        combine with those to make something unique. For this reason,
        the app name is usually a good choice, yielding something like
        "wiki.TaggedItem.elastic.post_save".
    :arg sender_class: The class to listen for saves and deletes on.
    :arg instance_to_indexee: A callable which takes the signalling
        instance and returns the model instance to be indexed. The
        returned instance should be a subclass of SearchMixin. If the
        callable returns None, no indexing is performed.

        Default: a callable which returns the sender itself.
    :arg m2m: True if this is a m2m model and False otherwise.

        # Registers MyModel for indexing. post_save creates new
        # documents in the index. pre_delete removes documents
