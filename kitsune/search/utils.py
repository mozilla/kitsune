    This helps in the case where you know the lengths of the sublists,
    need to treat them all as a big list, but don't want to actually
    have to generate the lists.

    With ComposedList, you do pagination and other things
    including slice the list and get the bounds of the sublists you
    need allowing you to generate just those tiny bits rather than the
    whole thing.

    Handles "length", "index", and "slicing" as if they were
    operations on the complete list.


    **length**

        Length of the ComposedList is the sum of the counts of the
        sublists.

    **index**

        Returns a tuple (kind, index) for the index if the FDL
        were one big list of (kind, index) tuples.

        Raises IndexError if the index exceeds the list.

    **slice**

        Returns a list of (kind, (start, stop)) tuples for the kinds
        that are in the slice bounds. The start and stop are not
        indexes--they're slice start and stop, so it's start up to but
        not including stop.

        For example::

        >>> cl = ComposedList()
        >>> # group a has 5 items indexed 0 through 4
        ...
        >>> cl.set_count('a', 5)
        >>> # group b has 2 items indexed 0 and 1
        ...
        >>> cl.set_count('b', 2)
        >>> cl[1:7]
        [('a', (1, 5)) ('b', (0, 2))]

        This is the same if this were a real list:

        >>> reallist = [('a', 0), ('a', 1), ('a', 2), ('a', 3)
        ...     ('a', 4), ('b', 0), ('b', 1)]
        >>> reallist[1:7]
        [('a', 1), ('a', 2), ('a', 3), ('a', 4), ('b', 0), ('b', 1)]
