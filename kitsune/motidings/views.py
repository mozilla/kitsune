    GET will result in a confirmation page (or a failure page if the secret is
    wrong). POST will actually delete the watch (again, if the secret is
    correct).

    a ``base.html`` template containing a ``content`` block.

    If you aren't using Jinja, you can replace the templates with your own
    Django templates.
