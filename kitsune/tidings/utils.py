    <tidings.models.WatchFilter>` are designed to enumerate. As a bonus, it is
    fast and available as a built-in function in some DBs. If your set of
    filter values is very large or has different CRC32 distribution properties
    than English words, you might want to do your own hashing in your
    :class:`~tidings.events.Event` subclass and pass ints when specifying
    filter values.
