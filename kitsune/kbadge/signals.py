"""
Signals relating to badges.

For each of these, you can register to receive them using standard
Django methods.

Let's look at :py:func:`kitsune.kbadge.signals.badge_will_be_awarded`. For
example::

    from kitsune.kbadge.signals import badge_will_be_awarded

    @receiver(badge_will_be_awarded)
    def my_callback(sender, **kwargs):
        award = kwargs['award']

        print('sender: {0}'.format(sender))
        print('award: {0}'.format(award))


The sender will be :py:class:`badges.models.Award` class. The
``award`` argument will be the ``Award`` instance that is being
awarded.
