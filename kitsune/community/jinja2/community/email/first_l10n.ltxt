Hi {{ display_name(user) }},

Thank you and congratulations on your first article revision on our Knowledge 
Base! Your contribution will now undergo review by our awesome community members.

SUMO has millions of visitors each month and more than 60% of them view pages 
in languages other than English. You may think that you translated just one 
page, but for all the users who speak your language it makes a huge difference. 
And for that, we're incredibly grateful for contributors like Wxie (https://mzl.la/41t5p8b), Michele (https://mzl.la/4m4xzib), 
and now YOU who went extra miles to help other users.
