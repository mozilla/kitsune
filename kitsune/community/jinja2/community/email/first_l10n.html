  <p>Hi {{ display_name(user) }},</p>

  <p>
    Thank you and congratulations on your first article revision on our Knowledge Base! Your contribution will now undergo review by our awesome community members.
  </p>

  <p>
  SUMO has millions of visitors each month and more than 60% of them view pages in languages other than English. You may think that you translated just one page, but for all the users who speak your language it makes a huge difference. And for that, we're incredibly grateful for contributors like <a href="https://mzl.la/41t5p8b">Wxie</a>, <a href="https://mzl.la/4m4xzib">Michele</a>, and now YOU who went extra miles to help other users.
  </p>

  <p>Here's what you can do next to keep the momentum going:</p>

  <p><strong>Get to know our style guide and syntaxes</strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li>If you're into the English KB, check out <a href="/kb/kb-style-guide">this guide</a> to get to know our guidelines.</li>
    <li>If you're into localization, check out our <a href="/kb/localization-style-guide">general localization style guide</a>.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    Additionally, you may want to familiarize yourself with our <a href="/kb/wiki-markup-reference">markup</a>.
  </p>

  <p><strong>Team up!</strong></p>
  <p>
    If you're onto article localization, it's always a good idea to get in touch with your Locale Leaders. You can find them by clicking on your language's name <a href="/kb/locales">in this list</a>. Send them a Private Message - they are there to help you help others through your localizing skills!
  </p>
  <p>
    If the English KB is your jazz, you may want to get yourself familiar with the <a href="/kb/content-request-process">content request process</a> to understand our workflow.
  </p>

  <p><strong>Learn the basic</strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li>Check out <a href="/kb/how-contribute-knowledge-base">these guidelines</a> to get started in the KB</li>
