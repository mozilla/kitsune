  <p>Hi {{ display_name(user) }},</p>

  <p>
    Thank you and congratulations on your first article revision on our Knowledge Base! Your contribution will now undergo review by our awesome community members.
  </p>

  <p>
    SUMO has millions of visitors each month and more than 60% of them view pages in languages other than English. You may think that you translated just one page, but for all the users who speak your language it makes a huge difference. And for that, we're incredibly grateful for contributors like Wxie, Michele, and now YOU who went extra miles to help other users.
