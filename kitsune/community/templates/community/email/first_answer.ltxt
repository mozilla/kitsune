Thank you for your first contribution to the Mozilla support forums! You just
made somebody's day!
{% endtrans %}

{% trans %}
Mozilla support is fully powered by our volunteer community that is helping
hundreds of users everyday. This community is formed by passionate Firefox and
Thunderbird users who take some of their spare time to help others. We couldn't
do it without your passion and enthusiasm. Your contribution, as minor as it
might seem, has tremendous value. Solving one issue in the support forums can
help up to 1000 users a day!

We are always very happy to hear from new people who like helping on the forums
so if you haven’t met our community yet please take a minute to introduce
yourself. If you want to stay low-profile, that’s also ok :). You can also find
us all hanging out on IRC, on the #sumo channel on irc.mozilla.org.
