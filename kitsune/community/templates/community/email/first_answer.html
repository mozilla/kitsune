      Thank you for your first contribution to the Mozilla support

      Mozilla support is fully powered by our volunteer community that is
      helping hundreds of users everyday. This community is formed by
      passionate Firefox and Thunderbird users who take some of their
      spare time to help others. We couldn't do it without your passion
      and enthusiasm. Your contribution, as minor as it might seem, has
      tremendous value. Solving one issue in the support forums can help
      up to 1000 users a day!
