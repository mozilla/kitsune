When I open the page in Firefox, the browser does not output any of the messages from my screen reader. I've reviewed the following article: [[Stage test owl|sed]] but it didn't clarify what might be causing the problem or how to resolve the missing content. I'm not sure whether this is an issue with the webpage, the browser or my screen reader configuration. Could someone help me identify the root cause and suggest how to fix this accessibility issue?",
