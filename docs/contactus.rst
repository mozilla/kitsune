Kitsune hackers
===============

If you're hacking on the Kitsune code and have questions, ping us on
IRC.

We hang out in ``#sumodev`` on irc.mozilla.org. We're usually around
during the day in Eastern Time.

If you ask something and all you get is silence, then it's probably
the case that we're not around. Please try pinging us again.
