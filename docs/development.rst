This covers loosely how we do big feature changes.


Changes that involve database migrations
========================================

Any changes to the database (model fields, model field data, adding
permissions, ...) need a migration.

We use `schematic <https://github.com/jbalogh/schematic>`_ for
migrations.


Running migrations
------------------

To run migrations, you do::

    ./vendor/src/schematic/schematic migrations/

It'll perform any migrations that haven't been performed, yet.


Creating a new migration
------------------------

Each migration increases the schema version number by 1. You can
figure out which schema your database is running by doing::

    ./vendor/src/schematic/schematic -v migrations

Migrations are stored in files in ``migrations/``.

To create a new migration, you'll create a new file in the
``migrations/`` directory. The first part of the filename is the
schema version number. Then a dash. Then some name that indicates what
the migration is for. See the directory for examples.

There are a bunch of ways to create the substance of the file. It
depends on what it is you're trying to do. One way is to base it on
the output of::

    ./manage.py sqlall <appname>

for the app that you made changes to, then editing that down to the
bits needed.

.. Note::

   If you created new models, make sure to insert the content type and
   default permissions. e.g. Something like this::

      INSERT INTO django_content_type (name, app_label, model) VALUES
          ('record', 'search', 'record');
      SET @ct = (SELECT id from django_content_type WHERE app_label='search'
          and model='record');
      INSERT INTO auth_permission (name, content_type_id, codename) VALUES
          ('Can add record', @ct, 'add_record'),
          ('Can change record', @ct, 'change_record'),
          ('Can delete record', @ct, 'delete_record'),
          ('Can run a full reindexing', @ct, 'reindex');


Testing a migration
-------------------

You can dump your db to a file to save its state, then run the
migrations. That way if the migration has bugs, you can restore your
database.


Changes that involve reindexing
===============================

When we migrate from Sphinx, we won't be able to waffle all search
traffic over to Sphinx in order to push a change to our Elastic Search
code that requires a reindexing of all our documents.

This walks through the workflow for making changes to our Elastic
Search code that require reindexing.


Things about non-trivial changes
--------------------------------

1. We should roll multiple reindex-requiring changes into megapacks
   when it makes sense and doesn't add complexity.
2. Developers should test changes with recent sumo dumps.


Workflow for making the changes
-------------------------------

1. work on the changes in a separate branch (just like everything else
   we do)
2. make a pull request
3. get the pull request reviewed
4. rebase the changes so they're in two commits:

   1. a stage 1 commit that changes ES_WRITE_INDEXES, updates the
      mappings and updates the indexing code
   2. a stage 2 commit that changes ES_INDEXES, changes
      ES_WRITE_INDEXES, and changes the search view code

5. push those changes to the same pull request
6. get those two changes reviewed

Once that's ok, then that branch should get updated from master, then
pushed to stage to get tested.

That branch should _not_ land in master, yet.


Workflow for testing those changes
----------------------------------

Once the special branch has been pushed to stage, the new search code
is tested.  If bugs are found, then go back to the coding
workflow. Changes get made, a pull request is created, then things are
rebased into the stage 1 and stage 2 commits.


Workflow for pushing those changes to production
------------------------------------------------

If we're also doing a production push, first push next to production and
verify that everything is fine. Then continue.

1. rebase the special branch on top of next
2. push the stage 1 commit to production
3. verify that search works (maybe we should write a script for this?)
4. reindex to the new write index
5. when reindexing is done, push the stage 2 commit to production
6. verify that search works
7. verify new bugs that have been fixed with the new search code

Pretty sure this process allows us to back out at any time with
minimal downtime.


On the next day
---------------

If everything is still fine, then merge the special branch into master
and delete the old read index.

Announce "STUCK THE LANDING!" after a successful mapping change
deployment.
