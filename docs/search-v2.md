## Development tips

### Indexing performance

When adding or editing elastic documents,
you might want to add the `--print-sql-count` argument when testing out your changes,
to see how many SQL queries are being executed:

```sh
CELERY_TASK_ALWAYS_EAGER=True ./manage.py es7_reindex --print-sql-count --bulk-count=100 --count=100
```

If the result is much less than 100,
then you have a well optimized document for indexing.
However, if the result is some multiple of 100,
then unfortunately one or more SQL queries are being executed for each instance being indexed.
Consider using some combination of
[`select_related`](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/ref/models/querysets/#select-related),
[`prefetch_related`](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/ref/models/querysets/#prefetch-related)
or [annotations](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/ref/models/querysets/#annotate)
to bring that number down.
