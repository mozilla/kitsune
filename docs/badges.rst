Creating a New Badge
====================


Badge Image Requirements
========================

There are two requirements for badge images:

* Needs to be a square
* The maximum size is 256kb

Badge images will be automatically resized to a 256x256 PNG image on upload.
We recommend creating and uploading the badge image in these dimensions and
format. If possible, the image should have a transparent background so it
blends in everywhere we display it.


Awarding Badges Manually
========================
