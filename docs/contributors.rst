==================
Join this project!
==================

Kitsune is the software that runs `SUMO (support.mozilla.org)
<http://support.mozilla.org/>`_ which provides support for Firefox and
other Mozilla products.

Interested in helping out? Here's a bunch of things we need your help
with.


Help with support!
==================

First off, you can help people get the most out of Firefox by joining
the awesome support community. This community not only helps people
with their Firefox issues, but is also the front line in helping drive
Firefox development.

For more information on this, see the `quickstart guide
<https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/get-involved>`_ on the SUMO site.


Help with hacking!
==================

First step is to set up Kitsune so you can run it and hack on it.
If you have problems, please let `us <https://github.com/mozilla/kitsune/graphs/contributors>`_ know!

After you've got it up and running, check out the list of bugs that
are marked for mentoring:

https://wiki.mozilla.org/Webdev/GetInvolved#support.mozilla.org_.28SUMO.29

If you want to work on one of these bugs, contact the mentor listed in
the whiteboard section.


Help with making Kitsune easier for hacking on!
===============================================

We're working on making Kitsune easier to hack on. This entails:

* reducing the steps it takes to get Kitsune running down to a smaller
  minimal set
* making this documentation better
* providing better resources for people who are interested in helping
  out
* providing better scripts to automate installing and maintaining
  Kitsune

Any thoughts you have on making this easier are much
appreciated. Further, if you could help us, that'd be valuable to us
and all those who follow in your footsteps.
