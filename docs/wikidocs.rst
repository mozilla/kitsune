Important Wiki Documents
========================

There are a number of "important" wiki documents, i.e. documents with
well-known names that are used in parts of the interface besides the normal
knowledge base.

These documents make it possible to update content on, for example, the home
pages without requiring code changes.

In all cases, the title of the English document matters, but the slug, or title
of the localized versions, does not.

For a list of the documents, check out the `Managing Landing Page Content
<https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/managing-landing-page-content/>`_
article on SUMO.
