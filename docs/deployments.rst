===================
Kitsune Deployments
===================

This documents the current development (dev), staging and production (prod) servers for the ``support.mozilla.com`` instance of `Kitsune <https://github.com/mozilla/kitsune>`_.


The Source
==========

All of the source code for Kitsune lives in `a single Github repo
<https://github.com/mozilla/kitsune>`_.


Branches
========


Master
------

The ``master`` branch is our main integration points. All new patches should be
based on the latest ``master`` (or rebased to it).

Pull requests are created from those branches. Pull requests may be opened at
any time, including before any code has been written.

Pull requests get reviewed.

Once reviewed, the branch is merged into ``master``, except in special cases
such as changes that require re-indexing. See
:ref:`Changes that involve reindexing <changes_reindexing>`.

We deploy to production from ``master``.


Deploying
=========

We currently use Kubernetes for our infrastructure,
see the instructions here for how to do deployments:
